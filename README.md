# Beginner Lifts
This is a training program for a beginner in lifting. This is based on my
personal experience and things I've read. I've also chosen movements that
are suitable to equipment one may find in an "apartment" or "hotel" gym. If you
have access to a proper gym with barbells and a power-rack I highly recommend
looking at program like Starting Strength or Stronglifts 5x5. However, if you do not
have access to this kind of equipment or want to follow something else feel free
to continue reading below.

### Schedule
* Lift 3x a week
* Lift M/W/F
* Lift in the mornings, right after waking up

The most important thing when just starting out is developing a habit and being
consistent. In that sense I strongly recommend following the above schedule.

3x a week is perfect for when you're starting out. It's enough volume that you
will see gains without burning out. If you do less you may not
progress as much. If you do more you could burn out. 3x is the sweet spot.

I think M/W/F are the best lift days  because these are working days. You could
also do a Su/Tu/Th, Tu/Th/Sa, or W/F/Su. However, I think it can be harder
to make time for lifting on weekends with all the temptations of personal life.

I also think morning workouts are preferable vs evening. Sometimes plans come
up after work and you have to deal with them. I think this is much less likely
in the morning. Furthermore, when you lift first thing in the morning, you've
already accomplished something at the start of the day. This is a great feeling.
As a bonus, you will enjoy endorphins for the rest of the day. It can be tough
establishing the morning workout habit at first, but it will be worth it!

### Workouts
* Alternate between two routines, Workout A and Workout B
* 4 movements per workout, should not take more than 75 min
* Do a light stretch before lifting, always make time for this!
* Squat every workout, first movement you do
* Leg-Lifts every workout, last movement you do
* Make sure each workout is a little harder than the previous one

As a beginner, it's important to follow a consistent routine with
linear progression. You will certainly get stronger doing so. Eventually
when you mature into an intermediate lifter you will need more advanced
programming. However, as a newbie, the above points should suffice.

Also, regarding stretching, you should always make time for this.
Getting in the habit of stretching and warming up before lifting will help
prevent injuries further down the line. An injury can seriously, set you back.
It's important to establish good habits early on in your lifting career, as
doing so may be annoying/harder later.

### Workout A
* Light leg strech
* (Legs) Back Squats: 3 sets x 5 reps
* (Chest) Tabata Push-ups: 1 set, 8 rounds
* (Arms) Crazy-Curls/Dips superset: 3 sets
* (Abs) Leg-Lifts: 4 sets

### Workout B
* Light leg strech
* (Legs) Back Squats: 3 sets x 5 reps
* (Shoulders) Dumbell Overhead Press: 3 sets
* (Back) Pull-ups: 3 sets
* (Abs) Leg-Lifts: 4 sets

### Squat Progression
* Always be mindful of form
* Breathe in going down, breathe out going up.
* First time lifting start out with squatting the standard olympic bar (45lb)
* Each workout do 3 working sets of 5 reps, minimum 2 minute rest between sets
* Each workout add 5lbs more than the previous day
* Once you hit 135lbs (18 workouts starting from the bar or 6 weeks)
    * Add 2 warm-up sets
    * Do 8-10 reps of just the bar (45lb) as warmup
* Once you hit 185lbs (10 workouts after 135lb, or 3 weeks)
    * Do 135lb x 8-10 as warm-up sets
* Once you hit 225lbs (8 workouts after 135lbs, or ~3 weeks)
    * Do 1 set 135lb x 8-10
    * Do 1 set 185lb x 8-10 as warmup
* If you fail to do 3 sets x 5 of work weight, repeat next week
* If you fail 3 workouts in a row, go down 15 pounds next workout, work your way back up
* Once you hit more than 1.5x body-weight, look into more advanced programming

### Tabata Push-ups Progression
* Breathe in going down, breathe out going up
* 1 set, 8 rounds, 20 seconds of work, 10 seconds of rest -- 4 minutes total
* If you finish round before 20 seconds, you get extra rest
* If you finish round after 20 seconds, you get less rest
* Make sure to go all the way down, chest touching floor/mat
* Make sure to go all the way up, lock out elbows
* First time, do 8 reps of push-ups per round
* If completed all rounds, increase one more rep per round for next workout
* Once you hit 20 reps per round, look into more advanced programming

### Dumbell Overhead Press Progression
* Breathe out going up, breathe in going down
* Start with 20lbs in each hand
* First workout do 3 sets of 6
* Next workout do 6/7/6, then 7/7/7, 7/8/7, 8/8/8, 8/9/8, 9/9/9, 9/10/9, 10/10/10
* Increase weight by 5lbs once you can do 3 sets of 10, Start cycle at 6/6/6
* If you fail to do 3 sets, repeat next workout
* If you fail 3 workouts in a row, deload 5lbs, continue at same reps as before
  (i.e. if failed at 35lbs 8/8/8, deload to 30lbs 8/8/8)
* Once you hit 135lbs combined, look into more advanced programming

### Crazy-Curls/Dips Progression
* Superset these, do curls first and then right away do dips
* Minimum 2 minute rest between supersets (so curls+dips and then rest)
* Crazy-Curls:
    * Start with 30lbs (EZ curl bar: 20lb, 5lbs each side)
    * 3 parts to each set
    * First, bottom to half-way up, breathe out going up, breathe-in going down
    * Second, top to half-way down, breathe out going down, breathe-in going up
    * Third, bottom to top, breathe out going up, breathe in going down
    * First workout lifting at a certain weight do 3 sets of 6 for each part
    * Second time do 6/7/6
    * Third time do 7/7/7
    * Repeat cycle, 7/8/7 -> 8/8/8 -> 8/9/8 -> 9/9/9 -> 9/10/9 -> 10/10/10
    * Once you do 3 sets of 10, increase weight by 5lbs. Start cycle at 6/6/6
    * Once you can do 3 sets of 100, look into more advanced programming
* Dips:
    * Breathe in going down, breathe out going up
    * Start with 3 sets of 10
    * Do this thrice, then increase to three sets of 11
    * Work your way up to 3 sets of 30, look into more advanced programming

### Pull-ups Progression
* Breathe out going up, breathe in going down
* Minimum 2 minutes between sets
* If you cannot do 3 sets of 8 pull-ups
    * Start with assisted pull-ups
    * Set a weight that lets you do 3 sets of 8 pull-ups with good form
    * Work your way up following the progression to 3 sets of 10 pull-ups
    * Once you can do 3 sets of 10 assisted pull-ups, decrease the weight slowly
    * Keep decreasing the weight until you can do 3 sets of 10 unassisted pull-ups
    * Follow progression below
* If you can do at least 3 sets of 8 pull-ups
    * Do 3 sets of pull-ups first time
    * Next workout do 8/9/8, then 9/9/8, then 9/9/9, etc.
* Repeat prescription next workout if you fail
* If you fail 3 workouts in a row, deload by 3 reps, work your way back up
* Once you hit 30 reps per set, look into more advanced programming

### Leg Lifts Progression
* Breathe out going up, breathe in going down
* Minimum 2 minutes between sets
* Bring your legs all the way vertically above you, focus on only using your lower abs
* Bring your legs back down all the way vertically below you, focus on only using your lower abs
* Minimize swinging, minimize use of legs / kicking
* Start with 4 sets of 8 reps
* Next workout 8/9/8/9, then 9/9/8/9, then 9/9/9/9, etc.
* Once you hit 30 reps per set, look into more advanced programming

### Final Remarks
* Be consistent! Don't skip workouts
* Always be mindful of form, as the weights get heavier, poor form will result in injury
* I highly recommend looking up youtube videos on proper form for each movement
* Stick with this for at least 3 months. If you do follow this for 6 months you will be ready for more advanced programming
* Have fun and try to create a positive relationship with working out / weight-lifitng.
