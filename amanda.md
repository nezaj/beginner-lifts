### Preamble
Below is a write-up of the intro lifting program we went over in person. This includes notes on lifting schedule, frequency, progression, and form. I've also attached videos for each movement so you can review the form. I took care to include videos from a variety of women lifters so you can see how they come in different shapes and sizes. I hope you will find all this information helpful!

### Schedule
* Lift 3x a week
* Lift M/W/F

The most important thing when just starting out is developing a habit and being
consistent. In that sense I strongly recommend following a schedule. The one above is a simple suggestion.

3x a week is perfect for when you're starting out. It's enough volume that you
will feel gains without burning out. If you do less you may not
progress as much. If you do more you could burn out. 3x is the sweet spot.

I think M/W/F are the best lift days  because these are working days. You could
also do a Su/Tu/Th, Tu/Th/Sa, or W/F/Su. However, I think it can be harder
to make time for lifting on weekends with all the temptations of personal life.

I also think morning workouts are preferable vs evening. Sometimes plans come
up after work and you have to deal with them. I think this is much less likely
in the morning. Furthermore, when you exercise first thing in the morning, you've
already accomplished something at the start of the day. This is a great feeling.
As a bonus you will enjoy endorphins for the rest of the day. It can be tough
establishing the morning workout habit at first, but it will be worth it!

### Workouts
* Alternate between two routines, Workout A and Workout B
* 4 movements per workout, should not take more than 75 min
* Do a light stretch before lifting, always make time for this!
* Do legs movements every workout, first movement you do
* Leg-Lifts every workout, last movement you do
* Make sure each workout is a little harder than the previous one
* Make sure to rest at least 2 minutes between supersets and at least 1 minute between leg-lifts

As a beginner, it's important to follow a consistent routine with
linear progression. You will certainly get stronger doing so.

Also, regarding stretching, you should always make time for this.
Getting in the habit of stretching and warming up before lifting will help
prevent injuries. It's important to establish good habits earlier as
doing so may be annoying/harder later.

### Workout A
* Light leg strech
* (Legs Superset) Walking Lunges + Ball Squats: 3 sets
* (Chest Superset) Flat dumbbell Press + Flys: 3 sets
* (Arms Superset) Crazy 8s + One arm triceps extensions: 3 sets
* (Abs) Leg-Lifts: 4 sets

### Workout B
* Light leg stretch
* (Legs Superset) Walking Lunges + Ball Squats: 3 sets
* (Back Superset) Lat Pull Machine + Seated Cable Row: 3 sets
* (Shoulders Superset) Dumbbell Shoulder Press + Front Raise + Lateral Raise: 3 sets
* (Abs) Leg-Lifts: 4 sets

### Stretching
Doing a light leg stretch at the start of each workout will help prevent injuries and instill good habits. A mindful 10 minute stretch is more than enough. For some ideas check out [this video][leg-stretches]. Feel free to look up other videos or add in your stretches.

### Legs Progression
Do these as a superset. Walking lunges first followed by medicine ball squat right after.

* Walking Lunges
    * [See video][walking-lunges]
    * Start with 5lbs in each hand first time
    * First workout do 3 sets of 8 in each hand
    * Next workout do 8/9/8, then 9/9/9, 9/10/9, 10/10/10
    * Increase weight by 2.5lbs once you can do 3 sets of 10
    * Start new cycle at 6/6/6
    * If you cannot do 3 sets for the required reps, try again next workout
    * If you cannot do the required reps 3 workouts in a row, deload 5lbs, continue at same reps as before (i.e. if failed at 15lbs 8/8/8, deload to 10lbs 8/8/8)

* Medicine Ball Squats:
    * [Watch this video][throw-ball] for an explanation of the mechanics, but don't throw the ball up, instead keep it at your chest like in [this video][ball-squat]
    * Start with 8lb ball
    * First workout do 3 sets of 8
    * Next workout do 8/9/8, then 9/9/9, 9/10/9, 10/10/10
    * Increase weight by next heavier ball once you can do 3 sets of 10
    * Start new cycle at 6/6/6
    * If you cannot do 3 sets for the required reps, try again next workout
    * If you cannot do the required reps 3 workouts in a row, deload 5lbs, continue at same reps as before (i.e. if failed at 15lbs 8/8/8, deload to 10lbs 8/8/8)

### Chest Progression
Do these as a superset. Dumbbell bench press followed by dumbbell flys.

* Dumbbell Bench Press
    * [See video][dumbbell-bench-press]
    * Start with 10lbs in each hand first time
    * First workout do 3 sets of 8
    * Next workout do 8/9/8, then 9/9/9, 9/10/9, 10/10/10
    * Increase weight by 2.5lbs once you can do 3 sets of 10
    * Start new cycle at 6/6/6
    * If you cannot do 3 sets for the required reps, try again next workout
    * If you cannot do the required reps 3 workouts in a row, deload 5lbs, continue at same reps as before (i.e. if failed at 15lbs 8/8/8, deload to 10lbs 8/8/8)

* Dumbbell Bench Flys
    * [See video][dumbbell-bench-flys]
    * Start with 5lbs in each hand first time
    * Same notes as bench press above
    * One things to note, it's common for one to be able to press more than they can fly, in the beginning your press and fly weight may be the same, but overtime you may end up pressing more than you can fly -- this fine and is expected

### Arms Progression
Superset dumbbell curls with tricep extensions

* Dumbbell Crazy 8s:
    * [Watch this video][dumbbell-curl] first to see how to do a basic curl
    * [Watch this one next][crazy-8s-reverse] next to see the mechanics of crazy 8s
    * [Watch this version][crazy-8s] to do it in this order -- this is the order I personally prefer and believe is more effective
    * Start with 5lbs in each hand
    * First, bottom to half-way up, breathe out going up, breathe-in going down
    * Second, top to half-way down, breathe out going down, breathe-in going up
    * Third, bottom to top, breathe out going up, breathe in going down
    * First workout lifting at a certain weight do 3 sets of 6 for each part
    * Second workout do 6/7/6
    * Third workout do 7/7/7
    * Repeat cycle, 7/8/7 -> 8/8/8 -> 8/9/8 -> 9/9/9 -> 9/10/9 -> 10/10/10
    * Once you do a workout of 3 sets of 10, increase weight by 2.5lbs. Start cycle at 6/6/6

* One Arm Triceps Extensions:
    * [See video][tricep-extension]
    * Start with 5lbs first time, one arm at a time
    * First workout do 3 sets of 8, one hand at a time
    * Next workout do 8/9/8, then 9/9/9, 9/10/9, 10/10/10
    * Increase weight by 2.5lbs once you can do 3 sets of 10
    * Start new cycle at 6/6/6
    * If you cannot do 3 sets for the required reps, try again next workout
    * If you cannot do the required reps 3 workouts in a row, deload 5lbs, continue at same reps as before (i.e. if failed at 15lbs 8/8/8, deload to 10lbs 8/8/8)

### Back Progression
Superset Lat Pull Machine with Seated Cable Row

* Lat Pull Machine
    * [See video][lat-pull-down]
    * First workout start w/ lightest setting (go up if too easy)

* Seated Cable Row
    * [See video][seated-row]
    * Same directions as Lat Pull Down

### Shoulder Progression
Superset standing dumbbell shoulder press followed by front raises and then lateral raises

* Dumbbell Shoulder Press
    * [See Video][dumbbell-shoulder-press]
    * Start with 5lbs in each hand first time
    * First workout do 3 sets of 8 in each hand
    * Next workout do 8/9/8, then 9/9/9, 9/10/9, 10/10/10
    * Increase weight by 2.5lbs once you can do 3 sets of 10
    * Start new cycle at 6/6/6
    * If you cannot do 3 sets for the required reps, try again next workout
    * If you cannot do the required reps 3 workouts in a row, deload 5lbs, continue at same reps as before (i.e. if failed at 15lbs 8/8/8, deload to 10lbs 8/8/8)

* Dumbbell Front Raises
    * [See Video][dumbbell-shoulder-front-raise]
    * Same instructions as shoulder press

* Dumbbell Lateral Raises
    * [See Video][dumbbell-shoulder-lateral-raise]
    * Same instructions as shoulder press

### Leg Lifts Progression
* [Watch this video][leg-lifts-first] first
* Breathe out going up, breathe in going down
* Minimum 1 minutes between sets
* Minimize swinging, minimize use of legs / kicking
* Start with 4 sets of 8 reps
* Next workout 8/9/8/9, then 9/9/8/9, then 9/9/9/9, etc.
* Once you can do 4 sets of 15 reps of the captain chair with straight legs [watch this video][leg-lifts-side] to see the variation of doing it to the side
* Now incorporate alternating sets of front leg lifts and side leg lifts (first set front, then side, then front, then side. Total is 2 sets of each)
* Once you can do 4 sets of 15 for front and side move away from the chair and go to a bar. [See video][leg-lifts-hanging]
* Bring your legs all the way vertically above you (even higher than in the video), focus on only using your lower abs
* Bring your legs back down all the way vertically below you, focus on only using your lower abs
* These will most likely be harder than the captain's chairs, so start back at sets of 8 repetitions, alternate sets of front lifts and side-to-side

### Final Remarks
* Be consistent! Don't skip workouts
* Always be mindful of form
* Stick with this for at least 3 months. If you do so you will definitely see results and be ready for more advanced programming
* Have fun and try to create a positive relationship with working out / weight-lifting.
